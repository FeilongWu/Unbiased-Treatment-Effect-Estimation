#This repository hosts the source code for the paper "An End-to-end Learning Approach for Counterfactual Generation and Individual Treatment Effect Estimation". Please check the [Appendix](https://github.com/FeilongWu/Unbiased-Treatment-Effect-Estimation/edit/main/CEMVAE/readme.md) for the paper for more details about the algorithm and experiments.
To generate synthetic data, please use "synthetic_data_gen.py".

Once the datasets are ready, run "run_single_synthetic_VAE_EM.py" to implement training and testing of CEMVAE.
